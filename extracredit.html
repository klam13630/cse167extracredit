        <h3>Description</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In order to implement depth of field, I take the ray from the original generateRay() function and modify it slightly to take aim at the focal distance defined by the input by using the equation o + fd. 
          </li>
          <li>
          I then shoot 20 rays, shifting the origin of the new ray by generating a unit vector and multiplying it by the arpeture size, then adding that to the eye position. I subtract that new position from the direction generation previously, and fire the rays as normal, averaging the colors produced by the 20 rays. 
          </li>
          <li>
          A small issue I have, as seen in the above images, is that the images are oddly noisy around the edges of objects, particularly with larger arpeture sizes. Overall, though, I think they look fairly good.
          </li>
          <li>
          I implemented refractions using the standard equaion for them; flipping the normal if inside sphere, internal reflections, etc. To calculate what proportion of the lighting was from reflection vs refraction, I used the fresnel equations. One slightly mixup I had there was confusing which one corresponded to reflection vs refraction, which caused it to just look like a normal somewhat reflective sphere, but I figured it out.

      <h3> Description </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I implemented soft shadows using a set of 64 randomly generated blue noise vectors generated using<a href="bluenoise.py">bluenoise.py</a>; in the top set of images I randomly scatter the blue noise points in order to make them look less linear, but it makes it super noisy instead, which I'm not sure is much better.</li>
          <li>In the bottom set of images, I only use the blue noise, which creaters much neater penumbras, at the cost of looking very linear.</li>
          <li>I chose to do a spherical area light because frankly that seemed simpler to me.</li>
          <li>Notably, with larger radius spherical lights, the shadow in the back almost disappears.</li>

    <footer>Note: it is inadvisable to have something with both depth of field and soft shadows using my raytracer because I did not implement an acceleration structure like Octree.</footer>
